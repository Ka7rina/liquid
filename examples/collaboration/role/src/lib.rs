// Many actions, like the issuance of assets or their transfer,
// can be pre-agreed. You can represent this succinctly through relationship
// or role contracts.

// # Workflow
// 1. `receiver` creates an `IouSender` contract that indicates the `sender` on ledger.
// 2. `sender` excises `send_iou` choice on the `IouSender` contract.
// 3. An `Iou` transfer from `sender` to `receiver`.
